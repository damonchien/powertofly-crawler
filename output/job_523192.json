We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Summary/ScopeThe role of the Pharmacology group in Oncogenesis TRC in Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is to provide in vivo pharmacology support to discovery teams focused on identifying small molecules for the treatment of severe unmet medical needs in oncology and immune-oncology. The Pharmacology group is an integrated part of discovery programs, supporting the identification of lead molecules through in vivo model screening and the characterization of the mechanism of action of promising development candidates. The Pharmacology Department is responsible for the development, validation and implementation of acute and chronic animal models of disease, including the identification of pathway biomarkers and clinically relevant endpoints to characterize the efficacy of lead molecules. Members of the department provide leadership for discovery programs from target identification to development candidate nomination. There is a close working relationship with DMPK, Exploratory Toxicology and Translational Development. The Pharmacology group also contributes to development teams by providing preclinical data to support the clinical development plan.We are seeking a motivated Associate Scientist with broad experience and deep understanding of pharmacology in small and large molecule drug discovery processes.
