    "JobTitle": "Research Scientist, Augmented Reality (AI)",
    "JobFullDesc": "We are a group of computer vision researchers and engineers, within the Facebook AI Applied Research (FAIAR) organization, focusing on building technology that understands visual content and then democratizing it via vertical products spanning our family of apps. We're starting a new vertical team to focus on AR - especially as the company starts investing in new hardware like AR glasses.In this role, you will be working as a Research Scientist on developing experiments and prototypes at the frontier of AI Research for AR. In particular, we believe users will interact with our hardware via various multi-modal sensors. So, it is important for us to be able to invest in horizontal AI services and techniques that not just understand the world, but also are personalized to the user. This would include experimenting around AR user's visual memory (think \"my objects\"), egocentric understanding of the user (think egocentric activity recognition), personalization building blocks (like modeling knowledge graph of a user) that continuously learn (think incremental learning) with limited data (think low-shot setting). The team works very closely with the extended AR organization to take our state-of-the-art published ideas and helps deploy it at scale with all the practical considerations around efficiency and user-experience.Apply machine learning to computer vision problems.Collaborate with other researchers and engineers across teams at Facebook to develop experiments, prototypes, and concepts that take our state-of-the-art work to production for AR use-cases.Collaborate with Facebook AI Research (FAIR) scientists to facilitate research that would benefit us in the long run - this includes working in continual learning, multi-modal fusion, embodied AI, visual search, low-shot learning and knowledge graphs.Conceive proof-of-concept prototypes that establish overall system performance and also be able to think of ways to scale it up to become a deployed system.MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSPhD in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics or related technical field.Must obtain work authorization in the country of employment at the time of hire and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONSPhD in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics or related technical field.Must obtain work authorization in the country of employment at the time of hire and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.",
