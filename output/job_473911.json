    "JobFullDesc": "We are growing our digital design engineering team within Facebook Reality Labs Research (FRL-R) Graphics. You will use your digital design skills to implement and optimize state of the art graphics algorithms and systems. You will collaborate with silicon architects in developing and implementing next generation custom ICs to drive our industry leading virtual and augmented reality systems. We are developing the next generation of graphics solutions for AR/VR. You will own connecting our graphics algorithms together and demonstrating end-to-end operation of our designs. You will drive integration of our IPs into ASIC systems. You will also contribute to prototypes of these systems to enable rapid iteration on our designs. If you\u2019re the sort of person who is excited by the opportunity to redefine how design and verification of large scale digital systems is performed, we\u2019d be excited to talk to you.Develop efficient IP microarchitectures and designsPerform system-model-to-RTL translationPerform hand-off and integration of IP blocks into larger SoC environmentsMake area, power and performance tradeoffs in defining next generation IP\u2019s and SOC\u2019sDevelop RTL for graphics algorithms and graphics IP clusterWork with early prototypesAssist with algorithm analysis, verification and improvementPerform third party IP assessment for integration into SoC\u2019sSupport IP/SoC/bringup/test/validation and chip life until production maturityMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSBS Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering6+ years of experience as a digital design engineer and/or a microarchitecture leadExperience in RTL coding and synthesis (SystemVerilog or VHDL)Experience in microarchitecture developmentExperience with on-chip bus protocols (AXI, AXI-Lite, AHB, etc.)Experience as a digital designer at both the block and the SoC top-levelExperience with EDA tools (simulator/debug/synthesis/timing analysis) from major vendors (Synopsys/Cadence/Mentor)PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONSBS Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering6+ years of experience as a digital design engineer and/or a microarchitecture leadExperience in RTL coding and synthesis (SystemVerilog or VHDL)Experience in microarchitecture developmentExperience with on-chip bus protocols (AXI, AXI-Lite, AHB, etc.)Experience as a digital designer at both the block and the SoC top-levelExperience with EDA tools (simulator/debug/synthesis/timing analysis) from major vendors (Synopsys/Cadence/Mentor)Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
