    "JobFullDesc": "About Us:At Raytheon Missiles & Defense, you have the opportunity to try new things and make a bigger difference across a broader end-to-end solution, a richer technology and product set, an expanded range of disciplines, a growing global footprint and a more diverse team of colleagues and customers.Job Summary:The Mechanical Analysis and Test Department is responsible for ensuring the structural integrity of all RMD Products. From the preliminary concept to fielded weapon support, MA&T delivers innovative and robust structural analysis solutions utilizing methods ranging from classical fundamental and proprietary empirically based techniques, to state of the art finite element methods and commercial computer codes; all complimented and validated by tests executed in a manner to ensure cost effective yet technically balanced solutions.A structural analyst in the MA&T Department has a vast set of responsibilities related to structural integrity of every mechanical part and attachment on all of the RMD projects.  The selected candidate will be responsible for detailed structural analysis to support all phases of programs including development and production. The analyses will cover a wide range of difficult problems, requiring solutions that are imaginative, thorough, practicable, and consistent with organization objectives. The analysis tasks will span the spectrum from classical hand analyses to detailed analyses requiring the use of finite element analysis software. In addition, a structural analysis of this salary grade is expected to have a high degree of technical competence and be a recognized technical leader and/or leader of teams of engineering analysts.  Thus the selected candidate will work under only very general direction and will be expected to define the scope and level of analysis required to meet required objectives, and assist in program planning. The structural analyst will be held accountable for completing his/her work and the work of others on his/her team within the agreed upon cost and schedule. The candidate will be expected to present their work for peer reviews and to be a peer reviewer for other engineers\u2019 work. The customers of this position will include internal personnel and programs as well as external Government(s) personnel and programs. The selected candidate will work with the customer and engineering leadership to define testing required to validate structural analyses and to verify that hardware is compliant with requirements. In addition, the selected candidate will be expected to plan and support tests, perform data reduction and engage in structural model correlation. A structural analyst in this role will also be expected to assist with proposal preparation including estimating the scope of new engineering projects.Responsibilities to Anticipate:Perform Hand Calculations to determine scope of higher detail analysis modelsPerform detailed analysis to solve diverse program structural challengesPerform peer reviews of all analysis to validate process and resultsDocument results according to RMD standardsDeliver results to customers (internal and external)Act as a technical leader (help define/refine and/or develop MA&T department technical processes and tools) and/or lead analysis/test teamsQualifications You Must Have:Bachelor\u2019s in in General Engineering, Aerospace, Mechanical, Electrical, Systems Engineering, Applied Physics or related field from an accredited university.
