    "JobFullDesc": "The Facebook Reality Labs team is building products that make it easier for people to connect with the ones they love most. We are a team of world-class experts developing and shipping products at the intersection of silicon, hardware, software, and content. Facebook Reality Labs team seeks a Silicon Prototyping Engineer. The word \u2018proto' means original, primitive, first, anterior, relating to a precursor and so does this role. Our team is working closely with the best AR algorithm engineers to create first of its kind silicon to enable compelling user experiences. The only way we can build the \u201cright\u201d thing, is to quickly iterate on non-form-factor implementations to test our ideas long before silicon is available. Our end-to-end proto team enables this testing by creating systems from a mix of off-the-shelf components, internal IP at various maturity levels, and representative mock-ups for new investigations. A successful candidate will be a FPGA platform builder, equally comfortable working on boards, sensors, displays, RTL design/verification, CV/ML/Gfx algorithms, virtual platforms, OS/RTOS kernel and driver software and architectures, and who hears \u201cit's too early\u201d as a personal challenge. The position requires a developer, able to debug and extract solutions from vague descriptions of system architecture and workloads, who also builds impactful relationships across teams to find ideas, assets and assistance to explore faster.Create proof of concept at system and application level for silicon that does not yet existDevelop prototyping strategies, including hardware architecture, component selection, software enablement and mitigation approaches for maturity issuesCome up with solutions to effectively model the end-systems using FPGA (or Emulator, Virtual Platform, and other prototyping means)Work closely with product engineers, algorithm engineers, software engineers, architects and designers to quickly prototype new end user experiences and featuresMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSMaster\u2019s degree in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or similar Engineering field or BS and 3+ years Industry experienceExperience building FPGA prototypes mixing FPGA/emulation based designs and off-the-shelf components, system debug with logic analyzers, scopes, meters, protocol analyzer, etc.Expertise in RTL development for custom FPGA prototypes and proficient in Verilog, System Verilog (DPI, Transactors)Solid understanding of FPGA logic Synthesis, partitioning and routing and timing closure for FPGA PrototypesExperience in scripting languages such as Python, and C/C++ at the kernel/device driver levelSystem engineering and system debug experiencePREFERRED QUALIFICATIONSMaster\u2019s degree in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or similar Engineering field or BS and 3+ years Industry experienceExperience building FPGA prototypes mixing FPGA/emulation based designs and off-the-shelf components, system debug with logic analyzers, scopes, meters, protocol analyzer, etc.Expertise in RTL development for custom FPGA prototypes and proficient in Verilog, System Verilog (DPI, Transactors)Solid understanding of FPGA logic Synthesis, partitioning and routing and timing closure for FPGA PrototypesExperience in scripting languages such as Python, and C/C++ at the kernel/device driver levelSystem engineering and system debug experienceFacebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.",
