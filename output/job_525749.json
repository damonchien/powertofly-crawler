We enjoyed catered lunch once a week and easy access to many local restaurants, parks, and MARTA within a few blocks. Mario Kart 8 races occurred frequently. And we often worked face-to-face at a whiteboard or over each other\u2019s shoulders to share ideas, chat, and enjoy each other\u2019s company.\nIt turns out that those things are fun and desirable, but not required. We\u2019re open to fully-remote candidates for this position. Locally we\u2019re currently 100% work-from-home, but we\u2019ll be gradually reopening the office this summer. Starting in September, members of our development teams who are local to Atlanta will be asked to come to the office on a schedule the team negotiates among themselves; we\u2019re guessing most will be on the order of a day or two per week,\u00a0 and we\u2019re listening to feedback on that as we go.\n",
