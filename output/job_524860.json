    "JobFullDesc": "Uber AI's mission is to optimize and innovate Uber's products and business using machine learning and AI. The group consists of Uber's Machine Learning Platform team which enables machine learning at scale, AI Building Blocks which enable product teams to build unique experiences and engagements with product teams on their business problems.The group consists of machine learning engineers, mobile engineers, backend engineers and research scientists and engineers.About the Role\u00a0We focus on productionizing ML to improve end user experiences and drive the business. As a core offering, we are developing a platform around recommendation and personalization across Uber products. We strive to understand our riders, drivers, restaurants and build more personal experience across all users. As an engineer, you would be responsible for building these systems that are high performant and can operate at high scale (imagine every Uber trip) while leveraging state-or-art research. You will deliver these solutions from inception to production. These production systems enable some of most important part of Uber\u2019s business - Fares, Matching, Safety, Pickup Experience, product recommendationsUber is deeply rooted in the physical world -- our business requires a clear understanding of complicated real-world interactions and behaviors. We create actionable insights that our partner product teams (Rider, Driver, Eats, Safety et al) use to improve customer and trip experiences using sensor, location, and analytics data. We do this by researching new models and algorithms and building platforms to serve our insights to customers at Uber scale.What You'll DoBuild realtime streaming+RPC systems to process and transform Uber data for use in our ML systemsBuild batch data pipelines to do offline data analysis for various ML modelsProductionize Machine Learning models (e.g., telematics, trip events, knowledge graphs) that provide insight about Trips and Customer experiencesUse analytics identify issues, root cause problems and validate solutions that improve our systemsWork closely with customer teams to productionize, integrate and validate systems end to endProcessing sensor, location, or analytics data at trip scale (12TB/day)Basic Qualifications3+ years of professional industry experienceStrong programming and debugging skills - joy of coding (we mainly use Java, Scala, Go & Python)Big Data: experience working with data at scale, including experience with some or all of the following: Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Flink, Spark, SQL, knowledge graphs, document databasesArchitecture chops: you should have opinions on constructing software systems and good knowledge of the principles of fault-tolerance, reliability, testing and durability. You should be able to evaluate solution tradeoffs between correctness, robustness, performance, space, and timeProduction Systems: Experience designing and deploying high performance production services with robust monitoring and logging practicesProcessing Pipelines: Ability to build and interact with very large data processing pipelines, distributed data stores, and distributed file systemsPreferred QualificationsExperience with ML infrastructure and running models in productionExperience working with sensor or other time-series data (audiovisual, barometric, etc), or knowledge graphsFast learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on learning new technologies and don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. You should be able to adapt easily to meet the needs of our massive growth and rapidly evolving business environment",
