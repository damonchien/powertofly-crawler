    "JobFullDesc": "Are you someone that has a passion for working in the aerospace industry on products that are on the cutting edge of technology? Are you an individual that has a desire to be part of a team in a fast paced environment that delivers products that protect the war-fighter? Do you want to be a part of a Directorate that challenges you, grows your skills, and intentionally provides new opportunities across programs to expand your technical breadth? If you answered yes to these questions, we\u2019d like to talk to you about your career.At Raytheon Missiles & Defense, by combining our vast resources and investments, we are able to dedicate ourselves to solving mission-level vs. product-level customer challenges \u2013 together we can anticipate more, move faster and make a bigger impact on the big picture.Job Summary:The Mechanical Products Group is looking for a Mechanical/Electromechanical/Systems Design Engineer with experience in mechanism / moving element designs for its Tucson, Arizona location. Responsibilities to Anticipate:  In this position, you will be responsible for developing technical solutions for a wide range of moving element challenges, such as aerodynamic steering, thrust vectoring, attitude-and-divert maneuvering, pointing, and stabilizing of missile systems & subsystems. Responsibility extends across the entire life cycle of the product, from conceptualizing and design, to prototyping and manufacturing, integration and verification testing, through production support.  You will be expected to apply sound mechanical engineering principles to solve complex system problems while teaming with a cross-discipline team including electrical engineering, systems engineering, flight science, manufacturing engineering, supply chain and others. Specific tasks may include requirements development and comprehension, concept development, trade study evaluation, free-body diagram generation, first order structural and thermal analysis, gear analysis, material assessment and selection, 3D modeling support, datum selection and application of geometric dimensioning and tolerance, tolerance analysis, margin analysis, support of drawing development, support of manufacturing process and build tooling development, support of test process and test equipment development and participation in design reviews.  Day-to-day activities are highly collaborative, both internally across disciplines as well as externally with suppliers.  Hands-on opportunity is plentiful, as great emphasis is put on exposing designers to the hardware through participation in prototype building and verification testing, thus enabling firsthand knowledge of system performance. Assigned responsibilities could grow to include a team leadership role of a major hardware subsystem on a specific program.  In this role, accountability for technical success across disciplines (mechanical, electrical, algorithm, software, integration, etc.), risk management, system integration into the overall final assembly, and adherence to cost and schedule commitments would be required.An advanced degree in a related field may be substituted for additional three (3) years of experience.  Qualifications You Must Have:  Bachelor\u2019s in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM)A minimum of eight (8) years of experience with system or mechanical engineering servo controls or actuation systems.  Experience with any of the following;  development of different actuation drive systems, examples include power management, motor and/or gear train sizing and implementation (spur gear, ball screw, lead screw, etc.) or associated bearing configurations for optimization of friction and position accuracyExperience with electromechanical control actuation systemsThe ability to obtain and maintain a US security clearance prior to the start date. U.S. citizenship is required as only U.S. citizens are eligible for a security clearance Qualifications We Value: Twelve (12) years of experience with Systems or Mechanical Engineering of servo controlsExperience with development of CAS requirements, CAS architecture, requirements risk, requirements verification and validation, system performance & function, safety and environmental compliance. Experience in working with control actuation systems that employ permanent magnet brush and brushless DC motor technologyExperience with feedback control systems, including sizing, testing and integration, design-for-manufacturing, kinematic and dynamic simulation and analysisProficient in Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing per ASME Y14.5Proven ability to deconstruct higher level tasks into discrete lower level work packages and tasksProficient in generating free body diagramsProficient in Engineering processes and proceduresProficient in Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)Moderate 3D modeling skills with a prominent commercial software packageExperience on Failure Investigation Teams with FRACAS / FRB / FR / A / CAExperience with Pro/Engineer/CREO 3D modeling and mechanical drawing generationExperience using Matlab, Simulink, and dSpaceProven design and manufacturing knowledge in machined parts, injection molded parts, hobbing, broaching, sheet metal fabrication, BLDC motors, wire harnesses/flex harnesses and related components, corrosion resistant steels and aluminum alloysExperience with dynamic modeling using commercial software similar to MSC ADAMSSound knowledge of flight modeling & simulationFamiliarity with industry standards for system, DC motor, and mechanism design (AGMA, INCOSE, SAE, etc.)Experience in design and development of test equipment for electromechanical systems that operate under high load and rateBasic understanding of packaging electromechanical systems for management of grounding, shielding and electrical noise in compact designsAbility to estimate project / tasks level of effortAbility to articulate, in both oral and written form, to technical, non-technical and management audiencesCurrent DoD Security ClearanceAdvanced degree in Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Systems Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics or Computer ScienceWhat We Offer:Whether you\u2019re just starting out on your career journey or are an experienced professional, we offer a robust total rewards package that goes above and beyond with compensation; healthcare, wellness, retirement and work/life benefits; career development and recognition programs. Some of the superior benefits we offer include parental (including paternal) leave, flexible work schedules, achievement awards, educational assistance and child/adult backup care.",
