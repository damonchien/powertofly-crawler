The last-mile delivery market is estimated to be worth upwards of $7.5b AUD in Australia, with rapidly increasing consumer preference for on-demand services. Uber Direct has the potential to support on-demand delivery across a range of customer verticals - restaurants, supermarkets, non-food retailers, and many more use cases yet to be discovered.\u00a0In this role, you will build and maintain excellent operational processes, lead strategic initiatives, and support the growth of Uber Direct.
