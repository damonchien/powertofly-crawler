    "JobFullDesc": "Facebook Reality Labs is looking for exceptional researchers to help create the next generation of virtual reality.  Our research focuses on finding comprehensive solutions to complex tracking problems, delivering novel technologies and algorithms fundamental to future VR systems. You\u2019ll have a unique opportunity to work with industry-leading researchers and engineers who are defining the future of VR and AR.As an Applied Research Scientist, you will bring eye tracking research initiatives from paper analysis to full proof-of-concept platforms.  We welcome candidates who strive for a deep understanding of complex systems and who harbor a strong desire to push beyond state-of-the-art. Candidates will help develop novel technologies for eye tracking, particularly focusing on 3D tracking of the eye using sensors like depth cameras, coherent light and interferometric sensors. Candidates will make use of simulators and high quality models of the eye, together with 3D geometry and physical understanding of these sensors to rapidly iterate on new designs. Our team brings together hardware, software, computer vision and machine learning expertise, and candidates will be comfortable assembling virtual teams and/or establishing external partnerships to solve problems. Candidates are passionate researchers who can quickly prototype their ideas, communicate conclusive results, and then engage with others in a highly collaborative environment to bring complex research initiatives to fully fledged demonstration platforms.Research, model, design, and/or build eye tracking architectures based on depth cameras, interferometric sensors and other novel sensors.Fundamental understanding of emitters, signal reflectance models from complex surfaces, and sensors that form novel tracking systems.Work with simulators, renderers and 3D models to rapidly evaluate novel sensor designs.Build physical prototypes in collaboration with hardware engineers, and validate real-world performance against computational models.Collaborate with researchers and engineers across diverse disciplines.Communication and documentation of research agenda, progress and results.MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSPhD in Computer Science, Applied Math, Physics, Robotics or a related STEM field.3+ years experience with 3D geometry and appearance modeling, 3D reconstruction, numerical optimization, sensor fusion, and/or state estimation.3+ years experience with C++ or Python.Track record of achieving results as demonstrated in accepted papers at top computer vision or machine learning conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV.Must obtain work authorization in the country of employment at the time of hire and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONSPhD in Computer Science, Applied Math, Physics, Robotics or a related STEM field.3+ years experience with 3D geometry and appearance modeling, 3D reconstruction, numerical optimization, sensor fusion, and/or state estimation.3+ years experience with C++ or Python.Track record of achieving results as demonstrated in accepted papers at top computer vision or machine learning conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV.Must obtain work authorization in the country of employment at the time of hire and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
