    "JobTitle": "Washington National Tax - MDP Tax Manager",
    "JobFullDesc": " MDP Program Description  The mission of the Management Development Program (MDP) is to place high-performing professionals (experienced senior consultants through senior managers) in challenging technical or operational assignments that will help them enrich their skills and develop a more complete understanding of the organization's mission, strategies, and resources, thereby significantly benefiting our clients, practice offices, and the organization. Eligibility   Experienced senior consultants through senior managers, who are ranked in the top 25% of their peer group, are eligible to participate in the program. These individuals will have demonstrated excellent leadership skills throughout their career within the Deloitte U.S. Firms and will have a local practice office partner who will sponsor them for such an opportunity. While some assignments specify the appropriate level of experience desired, most assignments assume that participants will start an MDP assignment approximately one year after being promoted to manager. While this is the suggested timing, the program is very flexible, since the decision on when to participate needs to take into account the career development opportunities available to the participant in his or her practice office and his or her personal needs and obligations.  MDP Opportunities   View the current MDP opportunities on DeloitteNet. New opportunities may appear throughout the year from various sponsoring groups and offices.Nomination ProcessIf a professional has an interest in the Management Development Program, the first step is to discuss it at a local office level with his or her advisor and/or partner-in-charge. The practice office partner-in-charge, as well as the regional leader, must approve the nomination. Once the decision is made to pursue a particular opportunity, a candidate may obtain a copy of the MDP Nomination Form on the page of the specific function you are applying to on DeloitteNet. The form should be completed by the candidate, in conjunction with his or her practice office sponsoring partner. By nominating a candidate, a sponsoring partner is confirming a candidate's high potential and his or her support for this individual. Nominations must be signed by the sponsoring partner, and co-signed by both the local partner-in-charge and the regional or functional managing partner. A signed copy of the MDP Nomination Form must be sent to the respective functional MDP coordinator. Interview Process Upon receipt of the signed MDP Nomination Form, the receiving office will review the application and speak with the appropriate sponsors for the candidate. After the prescreening process has been completed, a candidate may then be invited for an interview.Duration of AssignmentsAssignments are two years in length.Relocation If a candidate is selected for an MDP assignment and meets the guidelines for a firm sponsored relocation, he or she will be assigned a National Office Relocation Consultant. This individual will provide guidance and assistance surrounding the logistics of the relocation.Residency Status For tax purposes, MDP assignments are no longer considered temporary assignments. Therefore, the participant officially becomes a resident of the city/state to which they are relocated-and are responsible for any corresponding taxation issues (e.g. New York City and state income tax).Independence Representation All MDP participants who are transferred to a new office are responsible for ensuring their compliance with independence requirements. All MDP participants who are in a national role will have partner restrictions. MDP participants who work only in a specific cluster or on specific clients will have restrictions based on those responsibilities. For questions regarding independence requirements and ensuring that you are in compliance upon transferring to a new office/role, please contact the Independence group in National Office Stamford.",
