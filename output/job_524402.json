    "JobFullDesc": " Investment Management & Real Estate-Financial Services-Transformation Strategy & Design (TS&D) Manager  Deloitte's Transformation Strategy & Design market offering focuses on what we call \"big T\" Transformations - we help deliver fundamental shifts for our clients who are looking to either optimize, evolve, or reinvent their business. By helping them articulate their transformation ambition, architect new business models, design new capabilities that capitalize on emerging technology, configure an enterprise operating model, and optimize their organizational profitability, we help our clients organize and realize their transformation goals. Due to the unprecedented impact of digital and disruptive drivers influencing enterprise decision-making from \"tip-of-the-spear\" strategic thinking, down through the capabilities that enable forward-thinking transformation ambitions, the role of designing transformations with a business and cost-focused lens is extremely important. Often our clients must fund their transformations by turning inward, improving core business efficiency and profitability by focusing on multiple value levers-growth, liquidity, cost, talent, and risk - to fund and incubate new business models and/or new operational structures that we help design. Deloitte's TS&D practice helps our clients understand trade-offs between margin-improvement opportunities and rapidly identify offerings with the greatest impact and long-term value to their business. Our work helps unlock the funding clients need to grow and transform their business.  Work you'll do   You will lead a team and advise clients as you assess the transformational catalysts that trigger our client's ambition, help them define where they want to go, and ultimately orient them on a path to success as they weigh costs and benefits of their transformation effort.

You will be expected to implement and oversee the quality of deliverables and effectively manage the team and day-to-day relationships to ensure exceptional performance. Managers participate in the development and presentation of proposals for business development activities. You will have the opportunity to lead small engagements or components of large, complex engagements.
