    "JobFullDesc": "Job Description: Raytheon Intelligence and Space (RIS) is seeking a Mission Analyst to support definition and development of new capabilities created by leading edge, high-tech mission systems.  The RIS system portfolio is rich with RF and EOIR solutions that enable leap-ahead capabilities for the modern mission.  A mission analyst helps define mission requirements, explore new CONOPS, and make recommendations for investments using tools such as modeling & simulation and virtual prototyping.  The mission analyst advances the state of the art of these capabilities for each phase of the find, fix, target, track, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) chain using sensor, effects, and communications technologies. Candidate will work with Systems Analyst and System Modelers to define experiments including the operational context (threat environment), trade space, and analytical methods to execute analysis plans that characterize the value of current, upgraded and next gen Raytheon systems to the warfighter. The Mission Analyst will define mission and systems level trade studies using mission-modeling tools to generate compelling evidence to answer system design questions, support customer-shaping efforts, or define proposal discriminators. The mission analyst is providing the answer to the question \u201cSo what?\u201d  The candidate must be able to work with subject matter experts to define suitable operational environments, interpret complex simulation outputs and translate them into well-reasoned explanations.  Just as important, the mission analyst must be able to identify false results produced by the tools.  The analyst will work with modelers and system\u2019s SMEs to ensure that the system performance is represented accurately and used properly in an operational context.  The candidate will present their results to internal and external customers.
