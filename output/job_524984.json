Learn more at elastic.co.\nThe Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Logs solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market.\u00a0\nAs a Senior Go Engineer, APM, you will be part of a team developing high quality, open and free APM products that are part of the ingest flow of the Elastic APM solution. You will be working on the APM Server and the APM Go agent. The APM Server is a stateless component that receives data from APM agents and validates and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents. It controls the amount of data flowing into Elasticsearch and can buffer data temporarily without adding overhead to the APM agents. The APM Server also acts as middleware for several use cases, such as applying source mapping for JavaScript in the browser. The APM Go agent enables users to trace the execution of operations in Go applications, sending performance metrics and errors to the Elastic APM Server. As part of the Go APM team, you\u2019ll be deeply involved with the entire APM Server and Go agent codebase and take on responsibilities for new features. You will also be engaging with the open source community.\nYou will work closely with the rest of the team, collaborate with the APM agent team when adding new features to the server API and the Go agent and work with the UI team to ensure that we deliver the best possible experience for developers using our APM product.
