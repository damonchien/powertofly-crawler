    "JobTitle": "Senior Researcher \u2013 Machine Learning (Cloud storage systems)",
    "JobFullDesc": "Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK) is searching for applicants with a strong foundation in Machine Learning and an interest in developing novel machine learning based solutions to challenges in data recovery, experimental design, storage systems design and optimisation, and systems control to fill several Senior Researcher roles within a team developing optical storage technologies for the cloud.\u00a0At Microsoft Research we have a unique opportunity to re-think everything from the materials level up to the customer service API to build new technologies that are foremost designed for the unique needs and scale of the Cloud. These technologies will have a transformative effect on how most of the world's data is stored, and machine learning will play a crucial role in their production design, as well as their entire research and production lifecycles.\u00a0The researchers will join a multidisciplinary team of experts in optics, computer systems, materials science, as well as software engineering to develop new technologies for the cloud-era. In contrast to many ML applications, we co-develop the models along with the hardware that generates the data, which is also an ideal setting for supervised learning, allowing us to generate [almost-] limitless training data. Our broad team's cross-disciplinary nature also enables quick interpretation of experimental results, actionable insights to improve hardware, and the ability to draw on domain knowledge from different areas when developing and training innovative machine learning models.\u00a0Thus far, we employ a variety of supervised deep learning approaches, optimization techniques (e.g. Bayesian), and reinforcement learning, with plenty of scope to apply and develop state-of-the-art techniques to uniquely new problems.\u00a0Further information about our work in optical storage see: https://aka.ms/ProjectHSD and https://aka.ms/Silica.ResponsibilitiesIn this role, you will be empowered to drive data-based innovation across the stack towards more intelligent systems. Collaborate with experts in machine learning across the lab. Work with and mentor less experienced researchers in machine learning. Communicate research results to the wider project team and our stakeholders. We are looking for individuals who can drive a cutting-edge research agenda to push the state-of-the-art in machine learning for optical storage technologies. You will join an established team and get access to our state-of-the-art facilities and resources.QualificationsMinimum Qualifications (essential):PhD in machine learning, computer science, physics, applied maths, a similar discipline, or at least 3 years of professional experience in machine learning area.Programming experience in Python.Strong software engineering skills for rapid and accurate development.Creative and collaborative approach to problem solving.Preferred Qualifications (non-essential):Publishing track record in machine learning applied to physical sciences, engineering, or computer vision (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, etc.)Expertise in deep learning for image processing.Experience working in large Python codebases and PyTorch.Demonstrated success in applying machine learning to physics-related problems with real-world impact.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, color, family or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, protected veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances.\u00a0\u00a0Benefits/perks listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Microsoft and the country where you work.",
